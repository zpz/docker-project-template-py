# docker-project-template-py

This is a Python project template in my Docker stack.

The main thing in the project (or "repo") is a Python package located in the directory [./src/](./src) and testing code in [./tests/](./tests).

Pay attention to the config file `setup.cfg` and the version defined in the package's init module.
